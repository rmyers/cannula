Tutorial
========

How to make an application with Cannula. In this tutorial we will create
a dashboard application. This will use `Cannula` and `FastAPI` as the backend
and a simple UI with `Jinja` templates. Then we will add a reactive UI with
a small set of Javascript libraries `VanJS` and `graphql-request`.

One of the great things about GraphQL schema first design is there is a ton
of tooling in place to auto generate much of the code. This can be as simple
as the base types you use or as complex as Apollo client bindings for
`React` or `Angular`.

Since `Cannula` is a Python library we'll focus more on the server-side, and
not too much on the UI. Our application will have a number of detail views
plus a dashboard to show some high level view of all the data. All the code
samples are in the git repo so you can try each step or just skip to the end
and run the full application (Chester Cheata').
