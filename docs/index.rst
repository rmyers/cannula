Cannula Documentation
=====================

Using GraphQL you can simplify your web application stack and reduce
dependencies to achieve the same customer experience without regret. By using
just a few core libraries you can increase productivity and make your
application easier to maintain.

Cannula's codegen feature makes it possible to keep your python code well
typed without much effort. How you access your data is your choice but
with a little structure up front you can keep your frontend and backend
in sync. This frees up your team to evolve a project and not just collect
technical debt.
