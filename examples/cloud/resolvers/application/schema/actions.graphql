## Application Actions

This is an generic action type that could be preformed on some other type.
The particular actions that are possible are determined by the type of object
and the state of the object and potetially the permissions of the user.
We can define the action and inputs required with validation rules. That
way we can re-use the same components on the front end with all of the logic
to display forms or messages in a central spot.

Actions should be small and not require a ton of user input. Some good
examples are a delete confirmation box, or a rename widget. Actions that
require a complex form or multiple data sources should most likely define
their own custom types.
